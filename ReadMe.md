# Source Code Library for Microchip SAM MCUs
This repository has shared source code for my projects that use Microchip SAM C and SAM D
microctrollers. Functionality includes buffered serial I/O, timers, USB, FAT file, etc.
This project is source code only (often templates) that must be compiled with the project
using it. Any project which requires it will have a link to here in its ReadMe.
